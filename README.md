# tasks-prioritizing-board


We will build a tasks management board and deploy it on firebase (host)
The board layout will contain 3 priority-level columns:

- Urgent,
- Important,
- Nice to have,

Task model:
`{ id, title, description, priority}`

Functionality:
- Add task
- Edit task

We will use vue dragula wrapper for drag and drop.
